# 3Dbub
3Dbub is a comprehensive repository that provides machine learning-based tools for image segmentation of two-phase flows in corrugated channels. This repository includes trained weights for the segmentation models, annotated images used for training and MATLAB scripts for bubble volume reconstruction and void fraction estimation. 

## Features
- Pre-trained weights for image segmentation models based on U-Net architecture tailored to two-phase flow in corrugated channels.
- MATLAB scripts for accurate volume reconstruction and void fraction estimation.
- Annotated images used for training.

## Contents
- `matlab_scripts/`: Collection of MATLAB scripts for volume reconstruction and void fraction estimation.
- `model_weights/`: Directory containing the pre-trained weights for the U-net segmentation model ("3Dbub.caffemodel.h5", once extracted) and the model architecture ("3Dbub.modeldef.h5").
- `training_images/`: The annotated images used for model training.
